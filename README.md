# Video Surveillance for Road Traffic Monitoring
### Master in Computer Vision - M6 Video analysis - Team 8
<p align="justify"><b>Goal:</b> The goal of this project is to learn the basic concepts and techniques related to video sequences processing, mainly for surveillance applications. We will focus on video sequences from outdoor scenarios, with the application of traffic monitoring in mind. The main techniques of video processing will be applied in the context of video surveillance: background modelling, moving object segmentation, motion estimation and compensation and video object tracking.</p>

## Explanation
We are experimenting on Python3.7 
- datasets/: AICity_data dataset path, frames of video
- annotations/: useful annotations for evaluate the resluts
- utils/: useful tools to do different things, such as transfer frames to gif image 

## Week1
- **Task 1:** Segmentation metrics. Understand precision & recall.
- **Task 2:** Segmentation metrics. Temporal analysis.
- **Task 3:** Optical flow evaluation metrics.
- **Task 4:** De-synchornized results.


## Week2
- **Task 1:** Gaussian distribution
  - Task 1.2&1.3: Evaluate results 
- **Task 2:** Adaptive modelling.
  - Task 2.1: Recursive Gaussian modeling
  - Task 2.2: Evaluate and compare to non-recursive
- **Task 3:** Compare with state-of-the-art
- **Task 4:** Color sequences


## Week3
- **Task 1:** Object detection
  - Task 1.1: Off-the-shelf
  - Task 1.2: Fine-tune to your data
  - Task 1.3: K-Fold Cross-validation

- **Task 2:** Object tracking
  - Task 2.1: Tracking by overlap
  - Task 2.2: Tracking with a Kalman Filter
  - Task 2.3: IDF1 score
