# Video Surveillance for Road Traffic Monitoring
### Master in Computer Vision - M6 Video analysis - Team 8
<p align="justify"><b>Goal:</b> The goal of this project is to learn the basic concepts and techniques related to video sequences processing, mainly for surveillance applications. We will focus on video sequences from outdoor scenarios, with the application of traffic monitoring in mind. The main techniques of video processing will be applied in the context of video surveillance: background modelling, moving object segmentation, motion estimation and compensation and video object tracking.</p>
